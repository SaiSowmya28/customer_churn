# Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for subscription-based businesses. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, service usage, billing patterns, and contract types to identify key factors influencing customer churn.Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that helps businesses:
